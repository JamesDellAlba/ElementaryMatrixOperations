# ElementaryMatrixOperations

This program allows you to perform elementary row operations on a matrix in order to put a matrix in row-echelon form.

These include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a constant, and adding one row to another row.


This program does not check to see if a matrix is in a valid row-echelon form.
